# Gemini Project Analysis: Unicorn Properties

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the Unicorn Properties project, designed to guide development and interaction with the codebase.

## 1. Project Overview

Unicorn Properties is a full-stack web application built to manage shared living spaces, focusing on expense tracking, user management, and community engagement for a 7-apartment complex. It features a robust system for dividing expenses, tracking payments, managing user roles, and sending real-time notifications. The application is built with a modern tech stack and is deployed on Netlify.

- **Primary Goal**: Simplify apartment management by automating expense calculations, centralizing communication, and providing clear financial visibility for all residents.
- **Key Stakeholders**: Residents (tenants/owners) and Property Admins.

## 2. Tech Stack

The project leverages a modern, type-safe, and component-based architecture.

- **Frontend**:
  - **Framework**: Next.js 15 (with App Router & Turbopack)
  - **Language**: TypeScript
  - **UI Library**: React 18
  - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  - **Component Toolkit**: ShadCN UI
  - **State Management**: React Context API for global state (e.g., authentication) and component-level state for local data.
- **Backend & Database**:
  - **Platform**: Firebase
  - **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL) for all application data.
  - **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for user login and session management.
  - **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
  - **Performance**: Firestore queries now use `.select()` for field selection and `.limit()` for result size, reducing bandwidth and improving load times.
- **Deployment & CI/CD**:
  - **Platform**: Netlify
  - **Build Configuration**: `netlify.toml` and `next.config.ts`
- **Development Tools**:
  - **Linting**: ESLint
  - **Formatting**: Prettier
  - **Type Checking**: TypeScript

## 3. Getting Started & Local Development

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env.local`
   - Populate `.env.local` with your Firebase project configuration keys.
3. **Run the Development Server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 4. Project Structure

The codebase is organized logically, separating concerns and promoting maintainability.

```

## 5. Key Features & Logic

- **Expense Management**:
  - Expenses are automatically divided among the 7 apartments.
  - The user who paid the expense is excluded from their share of the cost.
  - Payment status is tracked on a per-apartment basis for each expense.
  - Core logic is located in `src/lib/expense-utils.ts` and `src/lib/firestore.ts`.
  - Firestore queries for expenses use `.select()` and `.limit()` for efficient data retrieval.
- **Authentication & Roles**:
  - Uses Firebase Auth for email/password login.
  - A new user undergoes an onboarding flow to select their apartment and `propertyRole` (Tenant/Owner).
  - The system uses a dual-role structure:
    - `role`: `user` or `admin` (application-level permissions).
    - `propertyRole`: `tenant` or `owner` (contextual role within the property).
  - The `AuthContext` (`src/context/auth-context.tsx`) provides the user's profile and auth status throughout the app.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins have elevated privileges to manage users, expense categories, and announcements.
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is used to send push notifications for important events. The service worker setup is in `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`.

## 6. Available Commands

The `package.json` file defines several scripts for common development tasks:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server with Turbopack.
- `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of the application.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality and style issues.
- `npm run typecheck`: Verifies the project's TypeScript types.
- `npm run format`: Formats all code using Prettier.
- `npm run insert-apartments`: A custom script to seed the database with apartment data.

## 7. Deployment

The application is configured for continuous deployment on **Netlify**. The `netlify.toml` file and the `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` package handle the build and deployment process. Pushing to the main branch will trigger a new deployment.

## 8. Performance Optimization

- **Firestore Query Optimization**: All Firestore queries for apartments, users, categories, expenses, and faults now use `.select()` and `.limit()` to minimize bandwidth and speed up dashboard and list views.
